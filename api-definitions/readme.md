<h1>ONS Address Index API Developers Guide</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>The Office for National Statistics (ONS) Address Index API provides public sector organisations with address lookup functions, via HTTP. It allows users to look-up addresses in England and Wales, and to select and retrieve the official address.</p>

<p>The API is currently only available within ONS, though there are plans to make the bulk match part of the system available via the new IDS (Integrated Data Service).</p>

<p>Work is also underway to create a new version of the system using Natural Lanugage Processing.</p>

<h2>Getting data from ONS Address Index API</h2>

<p>The Address Index API provides a number of end points to enable address look-up.</p>

<p>Each end point and its basic purpose are available from the <a href="explore-the-api/readme.md">Explore the API readme</a>.</p>
 
<p>A Swagger 3 also known as <a href="ai-openapi.json">openAPI 3.0.0 definition</a> is also provided.</p>

<h2>Address Index Simple Tester</h2>

The <a href="simple-tester/readme.md">Address Index Simple Tester</a> allows users to use the various functions available via the API, providing an input request and receiving a response from the API.

<h2>Code Samples</h2>

A number of <a href="code-samples/readme.md">code samples</a> are provided as a starting point for using the API
