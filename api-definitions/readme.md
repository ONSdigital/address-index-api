<h1>ONS Address Index API Developers Guide</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>The Office for National Statistics (ONS) Address Index API provides public sector organisations with address lookup functions, via HTTP. It allows users to look-up addresses in England and Wales, and to select and retrieve the official address.</p>

<p>The API is currently only available within ONS (for Census and other purposes) and a small number of other government departments.</p>

<p>Access control is currently via simple API keys, but OAuth2 will be implemented in future.</p>

<p>This API is currently in Beta and still being developed. There is no formal versioning yet, so there may occasionally be breaking changes as we enhance functionality.</p>

<h2>Getting data from ONS Address Index API</h2>

<p>The Address Index API provides a number of end points to enable address look-up.</p>

<p>Each end point and its basic purpose are available from the <a href="explore-the-api/readme.md">Explore the API readme</a>.</p>
 
<p>A <a href="ai-swagger.json">swagger 2.0 definition</a> and an <a href="ai-openapi.json">openAPI 3.0.0 definition</a> are also provided.</p>

<h2>Address Index Simple Tester</h2>

The <a href="simple-tester/readme.md">Address Index Simple Tester</a> allows users to use the various functions available via the API, providing an input request and receiving a response from the API.

<h2>Code Samples</h2>

A number of <a href="code-samples/readme.md">code samples</a> are provided as a starting point for using the API
